# ðŸ“ˆ Stock Market Prediction using MLP

## Overview
This project predicts the **next dayâ€™s Nifty closing price** using a **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)** model trained on **1 year of Indian stock market data (Nifty200)**.  
We processed the data, normalized it, created rolling sequences of 30 days, and trained a deep neural network to forecast the following dayâ€™s value.  

## ðŸ”‘ Features
- **Preprocessing**: Cleans missing values and normalizes stock prices  
- **Sequence Modeling**: Uses past 30 days to predict the next day  
- **MLP Neural Network**: 4 hidden layers with ReLU activation  
- **Evaluation Metrics**: MAE, RMSE, RÂ², MAPE, Accuracy  
- **Visualization**:
  - Loss curves across training epochs  
  - Actual vs Predicted next-day prices on real examples
